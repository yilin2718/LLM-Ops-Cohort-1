            "text: It's hard to put it into one word tbh. It'd probably be more effective to send someone resources that talk about ADHD/Autistic memory skills and how it affects us on a personal level if your intention is to get them to be more understanding (and they are willing to check it out) - plus the nice bonus is that published sources are typically a lot better at articulating these concepts than we are since we often use emotions and how we feel to explain what things are like. Luckily these days you can find tons of useful resources with a single Google search to help people learn about neurodivergence which I think really lends to the growing number of people that exist online that are more aware of the presence of ND people around them.\n",

It\\'d probably be more effective to send someone resources that talk about ADHD/Autistic memory skills and how it affects us on a personal level if your intention is to get them to be more understanding (and they are willing to check it out) - plus the nice bonus is that published sources are typically a lot better at articulating these concepts than we are since we often use emotions and how we feel to explain what things are like. Luckily these days you can find tons of useful resources with a single Google search to help people learn about neurodivergence which I think really lends to the growing number of people that exist online that are more aware of the presence of ND people around them.', metadata={'source': 'https://twitter.com/Spvwvky/status/1698451270162403837', 'row': 79}),\n",
