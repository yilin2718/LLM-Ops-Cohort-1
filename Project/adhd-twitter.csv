It'd probably be more effective to send someone resources that talk about ADHD/Autistic memory skills and how it affects us on a personal level if your intention is to get them to be more understanding (and they are willing to check it out) - plus the nice bonus is that published sources are typically a lot better at articulating these concepts than we are since we often use emotions and how we feel to explain what things are like. Luckily these days you can find tons of useful resources with a single Google search to help people learn about neurodivergence which I think really lends to the growing number of people that exist online that are more aware of the presence of ND people around them.

One of the problems is that anything even remotely close to ""I forgot"" sounds negligent to NT people cause they don't struggle with the same types of memory retention problems and can't really imagine it being such a common invasive problem in daily life. Object permanence can certainly get the way we perceive it across, but I still think it's important to make a distinction that you're only using it to describe how it feels, now how it actually is. A lot of people will just say that it IS object permanence but depending on the receiving person's understanding of that concept, it can skew how they interpret what you're describing.

Ultimately I think if we want to educate people about how to better help ND people it should be done in a way that doesn't perpetuate a false representation of what's happening, if that makes sense?
