The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 104}),\n",

The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 116}), Document(page_content=': 53\\nReview_Date: 29 July 2023\\nAuthor: planktonrules\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Good...not great\\nReview: \"Barbie\" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it\\'s obvious that the film is touching many people.
